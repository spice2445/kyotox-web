    <S.Text>
      Data is the new holy grail: the asset that powers the AI revolution. Without data, it is not
      possible to build and improve AI. Big tech - Meta, Google and many others - are built on
      monetizing user data. LayerAI is the 1st technology to successfully merge blockchain and AI,
      built to decentralize the wealth of the trillion-dollar AI & data market.

      LayerAI supplies data for AI: a trillion-dollar business ready for decentralization and
      disruption. Apps with 2+ Million Users Building on LayerAI. ChatGPT is the fastest growing app
      in human history - It was first to create an AI app that retail can use. But ChatGPT is funded
      privately - you can’t get a piece of OpenAI&apos;s success.

    <S.Text>
      AI projects exploded in growth in recent weeks - but they have a problem: none of them have
      enough users to reach virality like ChatGPT. LayerAI already has apps with 2 million users -
      the only AI platform to come close to ChatGPT&apos;s success. Developers of lifestyle, music,
      gaming, dating, travel & other apps join LayerAI’s ecosystem to unlock a new source of data
      income.

      Now is the perfect time for LayerAI to come out of stealth, developing since mid 2022.

    <S.Text>
      Data is set to become an asset class that powers the AI revolution. The increasing demand for
      high quality data to improve AI models is likely to lead to new companies creating a lot of
      value in the global data market.
    </S.Text>
    <S.Text>
      Big Tech players - Meta, Google, Amazon and others - already created trillions in value from
      collecting and selling user data that the users never directly benefitted from. Building a
      decentralized solution where users choose to productize and earn from their data opens
      untapped sources of income.
